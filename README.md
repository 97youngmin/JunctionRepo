# Snatch!
Snatch it, not Trash it!

## Description
Statistically, 33 - 50% of food produced globally is wasted. Food waste refers to the decrease in quantity or quality of food resulting from decisions & actions by retailers, food service providers and consumers. Food waste is an extremely detrimental issue as it contributes to land and water pollution. Food wastage that happens later down the chain such as distribution and consumption phases will exacerbate global warming. Food is wasted especially when it is close to, at or beyond the expiry date, and hence gets discarded by retailers such as restaurants and supermarkets.

We aim to reduce food waste arising from the disposal of leftover food at retail food distributions, such as restaurants, food centres, supermarkets, and other food service providers, at the end of the day, or near the stated expiry date. By reducing food waste, the environmental pollution will eventually be reduced, while improving the sustainability of the resources. We propose to introduce a mobile application that connects consumers and food suppliers to share information on food items that have not been sold by the end of the day. Consumers will be able to purchase items at a discounted price, while service providers can prevent food waste while earning revenue. This mobile platform will not only be economically beneficial for both consumers and food suppliers, but also help to reduce the food waste, and subsequently environmental pollution.

Built on Android Studios (java) with python flash as backend and azure storage services as database, the mobile application Snatch! is created to provide a platform where authorised food suppliers are able to register on our platform and start uploading food nearing expiry date or unsold foods instead of dumping it. These can offset their costs. They can also view the ratings, the number of followers and uploads made in the dashboard. They are also able to view analytics on the uploads that they have made. Through this, one can analyse what products are unpopular and further improve their sales. 

The user will receive a list of recommended food items that have yet to be sold. It will be sorted according to the user’s location and can be filtered by categories. The ratings and the number of followers from the retail supplier will indicate the credibility of the supplier and the food items it sells. More importantly, users can purchase the same products at a cheaper price especially if they are planning to consume it on that day. To purchase, “reserve” button can be pressed to reserve it for 30 minutes. However, no show will result in penalty points. At the end of the purchase, the user can leave the reviews and ratings and also choose to follow a particular supplier to receive push notifications everytime there is a new upload.

Snatch! clearly provides incentives for both consumers and retailers to utilize and seek for food wastage reduction. It  surely  is a game changer in food-related fields.
